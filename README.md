I am working on this little project with Selenium and i need a help looping over the image list on the page .
it is a real estate website, so i wrote a code that will automate the browser ,2. Open the the website (https://realestate.com.au ), 3. Click on search to search for available properties, 4 . click on first property in the list using find_element_by_xpath , 4 . fill out the property request form and send, 5 . Back to the property list and perform same steps
